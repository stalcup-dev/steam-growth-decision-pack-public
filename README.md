## The impact (plain English)
Steam discounts aren’t “free marketing” — they’re a tradeoff. A discount that’s too deep (or too frequent) can train players to wait and shrink your future sales. A discount that’s too small (or mistimed) can waste a rare visibility window.

This Decision Pack turns “Should we do 20% or 40%?” into a clear, written plan you can execute.

**You walk away with:**
- A simple recommendation: **when to discount next**, **how deep**, and **for how long**
- A **90-day calendar** tied to your next beat (sale/update/fest), so you’re not guessing month-to-month
- A reusable **playbook** you can follow for future sale windows (not a one-off opinion)
- Optional upgrade: **ROI/profit view** (requires your Steamworks exports)

**What happens without this kind of analysis:**
- You pick discounts based on gut feel (or Twitter), then can’t explain *why* it worked or failed
- You over-discount and slowly teach your audience to wait for sales (hurts future launches/updates)
- You under-discount and miss your best visibility windows with a “meh” offer
- You run sales that clash with updates/fests, leaving money and momentum on the table
- You misread the Day 1 spike as “success” and don’t notice the post-sale drop-off until it’s too late

## What this is
I help Steam devs pick discount depth, timing, and duration using lift/decay patterns from historical sale episodes. The framework: goal → discount depth → timing → duration → next step.

You get a **Decision Pack** (one-pager + memo + proof charts + playbook table) plus a **90-day plan** you can execute.

**This public preview uses engagement signals only** (playercount + price history). **ROI/profit conclusions require Steamworks exports.**
