## Who it’s for
**Fit**
- You have (or are about to have) a Steam store page and a real “next beat” (sale/update/fest/date).
- You want a decision you can defend: why this discount, why this window, why this duration.
- You’d rather run fewer, cleaner promos than “random discounting”.

**Not fit**
- You want guaranteed revenue outcomes or a growth promise.
- You need exact ROI/profit sizing but can’t share Steamworks exports (optional upgrade).
- You’re looking for someone to run ads/community/influencer execution (this is a decision pack).

## What you get
- **Mini (48-hour turnaround):** 1-page decision summary + depth/timing/duration recommendation + 90-day calendar starter + what to measure.
- **Standard (typically 5–7 days):** deeper memo + charts + a tighter playbook table you can reuse across future windows.
- **ROI Upgrade (typically ~3–4 weeks after exports):** net revenue/profit sizing by depth/region/frequency (requires Steamworks exports).

## Worked Example
**Situation:** Live game, planning the next seasonal sale; debating 20% vs 40% while preparing an update 2 weeks later.
**Decision:** Recommend a mid discount for the sale window (protects price integrity), then use the update as the next conversion beat.
**Schedule:** Sale → cooldown/measure → update → next promo window with a pre-committed decision rule (not vibes).
**Expected outcome (hypothesis):** lift during the window with less post-sale decay than deeper discounts; baseline shift measured over 14–30 days.
**Risks:** public signals are an engagement proxy (not revenue); competitor pricing and update delays can change the result.

## Pricing tiers
- **Mini:** fast, decision-focused (48-hour turnaround).
- **Standard:** more charts + tighter plan; slower delivery; still decision-focused (not execution).
- **ROI Upgrade:** adds net revenue/profit sizing; requires Steamworks exports; longer timeline.

## FAQ
**What do you need from me?**
- `appID` (or Steam store link), your stage (pre-launch / launch / live), your next beat date, and your primary goal.

**What can you infer without Steamworks exports?**
- Public data supports engagement hypotheses (playercount + price/discount history). It cannot directly compute revenue/profit.

**What changes with the ROI Upgrade?**
- With Steamworks exports (units/revenue/refunds), we can quantify net impact by discount depth/region/frequency instead of treating lift as a proxy.

**Do you guarantee results?**
- No. The pack gives a clear decision, an operating schedule, and measurement plan; outcomes remain probabilistic and should be validated.
