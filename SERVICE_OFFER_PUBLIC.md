# Service Offer (Public Overview)

[Request a 48-hour Decision Pack (2 minutes)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHMP8RZxLca6Tv56k1vsuSPZeAESdGoMzrz-VKMipNI1SO1g/viewform)

Turnaround: **48-hour delivery** for the fast Decision Pack (public-signal version).

**Scope boundary (fast pack):**
- Directional recommendations from public signals (depth/timing/duration).
- Net revenue/profit sizing requires Steamworks exports (upgrade).

I'm happy to reply with a quick directional next step (2-3 bullets). Full written plans + charts are the paid pack.
This is a concise overview of the two decision-pack options. For full pricing and scope, request the private offer.
