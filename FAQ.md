# FAQ - Steam Growth Decision Pack

Fast pack is a **48-hour turnaround** (public signals). Net revenue/profit sizing requires Steamworks exports (optional upgrade).

## How fast is delivery?
Fast pack: **48-hour turnaround** after intake confirmation. Net revenue/profit upgrade is longer (typically **~3–4 weeks**) after data delivery + kickoff.

## Is this only for big games?
No. But the right plan depends on baseline traction. Early-stage games need discipline more than deep discounts.

## Will this guarantee growth?
No. This is a decision system that reduces guessing and improves repeatability under Steam constraints.

## Do you guarantee revenue?
No. The public-signal pack uses engagement proxies (playercount + price history). Net revenue/profit conclusions require Steamworks exports.

## What do you need from me?
- Steam store link
- Your stage (pre-launch / launch / live)
- Your next beat (sale/update/fest) + target date
- Optional: Steamworks exports for net revenue/profit sizing

## Can you run my Steam marketing for me?
This is not an ads agency. I provide the operating plan. Execution support can be added as a separate sprint.

## What if we already run sales?
Perfect. Then we can stop random discounting and start using a discount frequency you can defend and repeat.
