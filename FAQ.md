# FAQ - Steam Growth Decision Pack

I'm happy to reply with a quick directional next step (2-3 bullets). Full written plans + charts are the paid pack.

## Is this only for big games?
No. But the right plan depends on baseline traction. Early-stage games need discipline more than deep discounts.

## Will this guarantee growth?
No. This is a decision system that reduces guessing and improves repeatability under Steam constraints.

## Do you need my revenue?
Not for the basic pack. Revenue is required only for ROI/profit sizing.

## Can you run my Steam marketing for me?
This is not an ads agency. I provide the operating plan. Execution support can be added as a separate sprint.

## What if we already run sales?
Perfect. Then we can stop random discounting and start using a discount frequency you can defend and repeat.
